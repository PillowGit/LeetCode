# LeetCode

Trying so desperately hard to find the motivation to do LeetCode Dailies

* [Pitiful LeetCode Profile Here](https://leetcode.com/PillowGit/)
* Don't look at my answers btw they suck and i'll cry if you judge me
* Any file marked with `d-` was done as a daily
* Otherwise, they are marked by difficulty, `e-`, `m-`, `h-`
